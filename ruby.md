# Context 
   With 20 years experience in strong typed languages - BASIC, LEGO (not sure if this count though!), C/C++, C#, TypeScript (yes it's a weak-strong-typed language), recently picking up Ruby/rails for work and that surprised me in many aspects in design, I see the powerfulness of the language but deep down in my heart I worries very much on the flexibility becoming bed of bugs, especially at scale, and/or also brings a ton of frustration to new-comers. 
   Every language has its own 'quirks' that you must understand thoroughly to avoid misuse (and sometimes catastrophic!) but ruby/rails **obviously** have way more than any language I know above in terms of that. 
  
# Motivation 
   Instead of just sensational feeling, I want to gauge it with concrete reasons and my hope is the DOs increases over time and would turn to a good 'on-boarding' experience for anyone want (or have to) learn Ruby. 
   
# My (computer language) values and principles 
Fail early 
Fail safe 
Self-explanotary
No (at least few) surprise
One approach for one thing
Syntax over convention
